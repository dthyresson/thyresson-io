myself O I suppose I do have to do that now myself when Boylan isnt around and Poldy hasnt
stuck me in 11 no 6 left and then ill be through with these socks I bought these for him
last winter we had a terrible storm stuck home cold as blazes he said and with nothing but
no thing to do and there he was going on about atmosphere when at most here it was -5° and
no socks for his boots theyll say I dont love him which I do even when he wants nothing
from me O couldn't we have another Milly is much better at this than I am into the fabric
out of the fabric simple really in and out in and O can't he be here tonight when Boylan
comes he could watch me like he watches those sluts sewn up in their imported silk with

Molly Mulvey singing in the concert halls of Vienna or Rome and the flowers thrown on the
stage O the sweet sweet smells but names can't be used since there's no guarantee theyll
stay the same Poldys changed since we first met when his touch felt like silk and he said
I tasted like a pear he might taste like a blood sausage or a sheeps trotter for all I
know thats what he eats I suppose it could have been the same if I was Molly Mulvey O
horrid Ms if I had to be called Ms Molly Mulvey bad enough were have a Molly Milly Melly
Christmas is what those foreigners say when you buy a pomegranate from their stand on
Barnaby street O the feel of sticking your fingers inside it and ripping the seeds out of
its pulp and its juice and softly bringing its meat to your lips and the sugar sweet
sweetness as sure as sucking and the redness that drips onto the sheets not a hole in them
that needs sewing he can lie right again in them after Boylan leaves O where is he do I
leave without him perhaps hell come with some bacon we can put on the fire with toast and
the blackberry jam we saved picking berries in the country before Milly before Boylan
letting their prickles tickle our hands and he used to lick my fingers clean and dry 3
more stitches with these dirty hands must find that soap he brought home last week when he
went to Dignams funeral Mulvey died I suppose and Rudy died and poor Poldy will die 2 but
just once before perhaps he can hold me like used to when he showed me the stars and said
I tasted like a pear this is his one pair of socks soon theyll be like new again and soon
hell be home op_open the door and well go to the concert and Ill watch him look at the
girls on stage and hell watch me glance at Boylan and fools as we are well look away from
each other I suppose did you realize no one can see inside of you did you realize the
world inside belongs to you O rocks the last of these damn stitches I suppose he might
have called our second daughter Moira sew so soon Boylan and I will meet and yes where
will he go when he's inside me and Ill be inside him somehow yes in his thoughts as he
walks around Dublin waiting for him

to leave and then reenter our bed if it could be our bed again 1 more time Poldy slip into

Critique
What is significant to the titles of the three sections?
The three section titles were taken from a Be, Inc. Newsletter (Issue 52, December 4, 1996) article entitled "The S in FS Architecture" by Cyril Meurillon. Be, Inc. of Menlo
Park, CA, designs software operating systems for their new machine, the BeBox™. As
described in the article, the basis for their File System revolves around their
multitasking architecture: the ability to process and communicate many tasks
simultaneously with little degradation in speed. This Be architecture resembles the acute
thought processing each Molly, Bloom, and Stephen reveal.
What can be interpreted by "Communication, in this case, could be through a pipe or port."
This resembles the way humans communicate. Non-verbal gestures aside, communication is
heavily achieved through verbal expression, whether expressed or internally thought. The
pipe or port is the medium through which communication is achieved. The pipe, then, in
this case, is the unique mind of each Molly, Bloom, and Stephen.
Is "Re-entrancy" an obvious pun regarding the sexual relationship between Molly, Blazes
Boylan, and Bloom?
Yes. So would be "thread-safe," but it went unused as the author could not envision Molly
uttering such a phrase.
Is there a countdown in Molly's section?
Certainly. The Be specifications say that the node which connects a file to memory is
only "freed when the reference count reaches zero." As Molly counts down the number of
stitches needed to mend Bloom's sock, she is freeing herself from the pleasure she once
knew in Boylan. She tries to free herself in order to be taken by Bloom.
Sew?
Penelope weaves; Molly can sew.
Why is the sharp biting voice of Molly not contained in the section?
The author couldn't recreate it effectively.
Does Molly cite any song lyrics?
Yes, however it came from the 1994 Portishead album 'Dummy' track five titled 'Wandering
Star': "Do you realize..." The author happened to be listening to it at the time he was
writing. The author would have liked to include lyrics from songs Molly knew and/or sang,
but was unable to uncover such lyrics.
What are Molly, Bloom, and Stephen doing?

10

Molly is darning one of Bloom's socks and awaiting Bloom's return before going to the
concert; Bloom is out fetching something for breakfast; Stephen, having quit his teaching
job, is somewhat awakening at Martello Tower.
Why organize time like that?
By having each of the characters in their individual space while sharing the communal and
universal element of time, the author hoped to demonstrate that while each of their
thoughts may be unique to them, they are wildly interconnected. Also, by reversing the
chronology from Stephen-Bloom-Molly to Molly-Bloom-Stephen the day structure repeats
without being repeated.
What time is it?
In each section, it is shortly before and after nine o'clock in the morning.
What rhyme is it?
Verbal word play is a vital instrument in language. The characters and Joyce enjoy the
acoustic signature of words and how proximity, related features, and orthographic
representations strengthen the connection between thought and meaning.
Is the author trying to be funny?
With limited success.
What of 'Thorough Generality'?
If Bloom is to be an Everyman, then in theory he could be thoroughly general. This
thoughts while not Bloom-centric do meander through a general scope of time, hunger,
feeling, and Molly. Be concluded that their file system needed to "handle a broad variety
of file systems." In Bloom's own way, he handles aspects of science, politics, human
relationship with the same equal generality.
And 'Parallelism'?
Be recognized that in their file system, piped commands are "often blocked waiting for
more data to show up." Stephen's thoughts show that his mind outpaces his ability to
express them. This idea could also apply to Bloom's manner of ending thoughts in midsentence.
Why did the author chose a rather esoteric computer article on file systems?
It seemed an interesting challenge: neither Bloom, Stephen, Molly, nor Joyce had a
relationship with computers, but since the article discussed information storage,
retrieval, and compatibility, the author saw similarities in which both machines and
people process information.
What is lacking from the sections?

11

A sense of causal flow and story. The voices tend to ramble without concrete direction.
But, in many ways that was the intent. Not to ramble, but to express impulses of thought
that built upon associations from previous sentences and the other two characters'
situations.
Did the author make up any names?
Yes. Landry's is not the shop in which Bloom saw the blouse. Likewise, Principles of
Identity is fictitious. Also, the author is uncertain whether or not Asian immigrants
lived in Dublin, so the stereotyped use of 'Melly Christmas' is perhaps improper.
Brueghal's painting is in fact titled Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, a poem as well by
William Carlos Williams. McIntyre's is not a bakery cited in Ulysses.
How did the author attempt to connect Stephen with his mythic counterpart, Icarus?
Fear of water, the ocean and associates on feathers.
Rather conventional.

Connect bird to song to concert.

Does the author feel that Stephen sounds depressed and suicidal in his rendition?
Yes. Too much so, in fact. But, Stephen seemed to go in that direction seeing that he
has no employment, no connection to family or support (minus his drinking mates), and a
grand sense of ambition with little or no motivation to achieve his goals, Stephen
continues a self-deprecating existence paralyzed by his surroundings with little hope for
escape except through the intelligent imaginations of a broken spirit.
Does the author achieve an effective response to the article in the Molly, Bloom, Stephen
voices?
Not really.

But, the article was used to seed the voices.

What does it all mean?
The author tried to see what would happen on another morning in the life of Molly, Bloom,
and Stephen on the day of Molly's concert. Molly, looking forward to another Boylan
meeting but still in love with Bloom; Bloom, always thinking about himself and Molly and
the world if only it could be Bloom-ified; and Stephen, who has no responsibilities of
note and is struggling to decide what his future could be. The idea for Molly to be
sewing a sock, attempted to show that she is still connected to her husband. As a phallic
symbol, it was rather unsuccessful. But, the lack of wearing socks gave Bloom something
to think about as he goes about Dublin to get some bacon for breakfast. Stephen had to be
shown separately, because although he has connected with Bloom, the author was uncertain
whether or not they would keep up their relationship. While, surely Bloom feels a
fatherly kinship with Stephen, Stephen appears to be removing himself from life.
Shortcomings?
Molly seems too sex-crazed; Bloom too obsessed; and Stephen too psychotic. Their voices
lacked the precise succinct details that Joyce uses to color their thoughts. Without the
details, their thoughts seem detached from much personal experience and approach madness.

12

Any successes?
The author thinks he was able to demonstrate the peculiarities of language and how each of
the characters consciously and subconsciously use language to connect their thoughts. A
friend who happened to read this laughed, so perhaps some of the humor worked. Yet, not
as brightly tuned as Joyce's. Although, rue du bac is funny.
