# Examples of how AI is used in the Classroom at Phillips Andover

Nicholas Zufelt, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at Phillips Andover, described **several concrete examples of how Andover teachers are already using AI in their classrooms**, both in his own Computer Science courses and in other departments.

---

### **1. AI as a Simulation Tool (Computer Science)**

Zufelt created an **AI prompt that simulates himself** as a teacher for students to practice oral exams.
Students feed their code into AI with instructions like:

> “I am a student in a computer science class. In a week, my teacher will quiz me on each line of this code. Pick a line, ask me to explain it, and give me feedback.”

This helps students **rehearse conceptual understanding** and practice clear explanations.
It treats AI as a **supporting partner**, not a replacement for thinking.

---

### **2. “AI as \_\_\_\_” Framework**

Zufelt encourages teachers to imagine different “AI as…” use cases:

- **AI as a tutor** – the familiar idea of AI guiding or explaining.
- **AI as a student** – where the human teaches and explains concepts to the AI, reinforcing their own understanding.
- **AI as a manager** – simulating an employee–manager conversation to help students plan and practice interpersonal communication.

This broadens how AI can be used as a **creative and reflective learning tool.**

### **3. AI in History: Creating and Analyzing “Fake” Primary Sources**

He highlighted **Dr. Carrie Lambert’s** work in the History Department:
After studying a real primary source, students **prompt AI to generate a fake version** in the same style.
Then they compare the authentic and AI versions to identify inaccuracies or biases.
This helps students **strengthen source analysis, critical reading, and prompt design** skills.

---

### **4. The “Seven-Prompt Essay”**

Zufelt described a widely used writing experiment called the **seven-prompt essay**:

1. The teacher gives a normal essay prompt.
2. The student gives that to AI, receives an essay.
3. The student then writes **six more prompts** refining and improving the AI’s output.
4. The **teacher grades the prompt log**, not the essay.

This approach assesses **editorial judgment, reflection, and metacognition** — how well the student communicates with and directs AI — rather than the quality of the AI’s writing.

---

### **5. “Unplugged” Assessment and Creativity**

Finally, he mentioned teachers who still assign **handwritten, in-class work** but use it creatively:
students might **cut up and rearrange** their written work, simulating the editing process digitally without AI tools.
This preserves **hands-on critical thinking** while maintaining creativity and adaptability in assessment design.

Together, these examples show how Andover’s educators are **using AI as a partner in learning** — for simulation, practice, metacognition, creativity, and critical evaluation — rather than as a shortcut or substitute for thought.
