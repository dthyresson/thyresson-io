**A. David Thyresson** (DT) began his career as an early employee at the Internet consulting firm Cambridge, MA-based and MIT-backed C-bridge Internet Solutions, which IPO’d in 1999. He worked for clients like Firmenich in Princeton and Geneva and Tesoro Petroleum until CBIS was acquired in 2001. Together with several colleagues, he co-founded Entessa to continue building Internet-based solutions for companies including Gateway, e-Machines, Opsware, bSkyb, Tesoro, and Valero Energy.

As co-founder of Entessa, he relocated to San Francisco to lead Information Architecture and productize an Order to Cash platform for midstream energy companies including Chevron, Kaneb Pipeline, Valero, Sunoco Logistics, Hess/Hovensa, Plains All American, and Buckeye Partners. In 2010, Entessa sold to Energy Solutions International for a 6x return.

Returning to Boston, as co-founder of Spogo, he created its prediction and stats feat engine that powered a mobile app that enables sports fans to win real rewards for making correct predictions while they watch live games. NTN Buzztime, Inc. acquired Spogo in 2015 to integrate it into its bar and restaurant social entertainment and integrated marketing platform. DT then led the backend Rails team at Cambridge-based Intrepid Pursuits, acquired by Accenture, before joining Sports Innovation Lab (SIL) as founding member and CTO. Under CEO Angel Ruggiero, four-time Olympic medalist in Ice Hockey, he developed information data pipelines to extract market intelligence in sports technology from startups, leagues, brands, and teams.

While at SIL, he negotiated one of the first enterprise contracts with Netlify in 2017, helped shape their early authentication product requirements, and began building React web apps that used Netlify functions as its backend infrastructure. After leaving SIL just before COVID in 2020, he met Tom Preston-Werner and David Price through the open-source RedwoodJS project, where he joined the core team to lead authentication and GraphQL. In 2021, DT consulted for Supabase and facilitated Tom’s angel investment in their Series A.
