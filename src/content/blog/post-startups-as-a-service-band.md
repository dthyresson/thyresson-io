### Background

Bback in 2020, I started thining about how startups start and grow. I realized that startups are like a band. Some startups are solo founders, some are duos, some are trios, etc.

That makeup often dictates the dynamics of the startup especially when it comes to the culture and how they scale.

Also, I knew from experience that startups lack many resourcrs (both physical and digital) as they grow.

I wondered, could there be a "Startup as a Service" that could provide the resources that startups need to grow?

This is an unfinished deck, but one day I want to explore this idea further.
