### Background

Back in 2020, I started thinking about how startups start and grow. I realized that startups are like a band. Some startups are solo founders, some are duos, some are trios, etc.

That makeup often dictates the dynamics of the startup especially when it comes to the culture and how they scale.

Also, I knew from experience that startups lack many resources (both physical and digital) as they grow.

I wondered, could there be a "Startup as a Service" that could provide the resources that startups need to grow?

This is an unfinished deck, but one day I want to explore this idea further.

A take on the deodorant-scented slogan that became a revolutionary anthem for Gen X.

Soloists. Duos. Trios.
Single founders. Co-founders. Multi-founder teams.

"Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer.
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!"

CEO's living the dream.

Startups are hard and you can't do it alone. But finding the right team and having clear roles and responsibilities is key to success.

I'd so invest in him.

Find your ICP. Find PMF. Find great design partners and people to help you on the way.

A little chaos can channel your creative energy to great things ....

... and many of the best innovations.

But complexity is always around the corner.

For startups, complexity compounds due to having to navigate both the digital and physical world.

When I started Stattleship, I took on the complexity of a small office and all the costs and physical infrastructure that comes with it.

And then I added on the digital complexity of the services and partners needed to build the product.

It can get overwhelming. Fast.

Question: Could you offer a "Startup as a Service" that provides the resources and support that startups need to grow?

![Startups as a Service Band](/startup-as-a-service/startup-as-a-service.020.jpeg)

You don't need everything right away ... but you do need to know what and when and where to get it.

Because a startup is about "starting". If you are a 5 year old startup didn't you start already? You're scaling now.

And bands know should also know how to play scales. :)
