In the fall of 1993, I was living in Stockholm, Sweden. Within just a few weeks, I'd get to see two legends live in concert.

### 25 October 1993 - BB King at the Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden

After the show, we realized the BB King was likely staying at the hotel next door.
We waited in the lobby, and when he finally came by, he shook my hand and signed my ticket.

### 4 December 1993 - Soulkv√§ll med James Brown at the Stockholm Globe Arena

Soul Night with the hardest working man in show business easily had 60 costume changes. And that was just his capes.
