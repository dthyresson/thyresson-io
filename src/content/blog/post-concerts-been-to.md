Here’s the updated version with a strong TED-style opening sentence at the very top, tied to the theme of on-demand vs. real experience:

# The One Thing I’d Tell My Niece and Nephew: Go See Live Music

**In a world where everything is on-demand, live music is the one thing that still demands you to show up.**

If there’s one piece of advice I could give to my younger self—or to my niece and nephew—it’s this: **go to as many concerts as you can**. Don’t let the ease of streaming fool you into thinking you’ve experienced music just because you’ve played it on Spotify, YouTube, or wherever.

Streaming is incredible, but live music is something else entirely. It’s energy. It’s community. It’s imperfect and raw and _alive_.

And here’s the thing: I can’t say I saw _enough_ shows—but the ones I did? They were **epic**. The kind of nights that stick with you for decades. The lights. The sound that rattles your bones. That moment when everyone in the crowd knows the lyric, and you’re singing with strangers. That doesn’t happen on your phone.

When I look back, some of my most vivid memories aren’t about stuff I owned or things I scrolled past—they’re about being in those rooms, those fields, those nights. Here are some of the shows I’ve been lucky enough to experience, in the order they happened. Each one left a mark.

## **Phish — Dec 6, 1991 (Middlebury College, VT)**

A college ballroom show, and the energy was electric. It felt like something special was happening in a small room—and it was.

## **Blues Traveler + Spin Doctors — Apr 23, 1992 (University of Vermont)**

This was pure early-’90s college rock magic. Two bands, harmonicas, and the kind of jam vibe that defined an era.

## **U2 (with Pixies) — Mar 23, 1992 (Montreal Forum)**

Zoo TV was larger than life. U2 at their most ambitious, and opening with Pixies? That’s the kind of lineup you only appreciate more as time goes on.

## **Lollapalooza (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lush) — Aug 8, 1992 (Great Woods, MA)**

It wasn’t just a concert—it was a cultural moment. Alternative music taking over the world, and we were right there for it.

## **B.B. King — Oct 25, 1993 (Cirkus, Stockholm)**

Seeing a legend like B.B. King in an intimate venue overseas? That was a gift. You don’t forget the feeling of blues played by the man himself.

## **James Brown — Dec 4, 1993 (Ericsson Globe, Stockholm)**

The Godfather of Soul. The energy, the moves, the sheer showmanship—this was a master class in performance.

## **The Chemical Brothers — May 14, 1997 (Métropolis, Montreal)**

Electronic music as a full-body experience. Beats, lights, and the sense that the future had arrived on the dance floor.

## **Sneaker Pimps (with Luke Vibert; Aphex Twin on the bill) — Sep 7–8, 1997 (Avalon, Boston)**

This one felt ahead of its time. Trip-hop colliding with experimental electronica, and Aphex Twin bending sound into shapes no one else dared.

## **Tortoise (with Oval likely opening) — May 6, 1998 (The Middle East, Cambridge)**

Minimalist, experimental, and hypnotic. Music that made you listen differently—layered, intricate, and deeply alive.

## **The Breeders — Jun 5, 2008 (Paradise Rock Club, Boston)**

A small club, a beloved band, and songs that still sound as vital as the first time you heard them.

## **David Byrne — Oct 7, 2008 (Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco)**

Byrne performing Byrne/Eno material with theatrical brilliance. It was art, music, and storytelling all at once.

## **The Breeders — Nov 15, 2008 (Slim’s, San Francisco)**

Seeing them twice in one year wasn’t a plan—it was a necessity. Different city, same thrill.

## **Sonic Youth — Jan 1, 2010 (The Fillmore, San Francisco)**

New Year’s with Sonic Youth. Dissonant guitars ringing in the next decade—chaotic, beautiful, unforgettable.

## **Cults — Jan 21, 2012 (Paradise Rock Club, Boston)**

A band on the rise, in a small venue, before they blew up. Those are the nights you later realize were rare.

### **Why It Matters**

Looking back, I don’t regret a single ticket. Every one of these nights is a story. A place. A feeling that can’t be compressed into a stream.

So here’s what I’d tell you: **make time for live music**. Even if you don’t know every song. Even if you go alone. Even if it means leaving the house when it’s easier not to. Because these are the nights you’ll remember—and they don’t happen on shuffle.

The future will always have playlists. Algorithms will always be ready with “songs you might like.” But what we won’t always have are nights like these—moments when the lights go down, the first note hits, and you’re part of something unrepeatable.

And me? Writing this reminded me of something: it’s been too long since my last show. That needs to change. Because live music isn’t just entertainment—it’s life happening in real time, and I want to be in the room when it does.
