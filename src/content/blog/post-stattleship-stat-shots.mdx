Wayne Gretzky said it best: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”

Having built Stattlehsip as "stats games for sports fans" as an alternative to the gambling driven sports fan engagement platforms,

<Image src={stattleOffice} alt="Stattleship Office with Chexx Game" />

I had a large set of data I'd ingested from Sportradar and a real-time feed that I could transform and enrich into feats, play-by-play, milestones and more on the fly.

I believed that sports are social. Real-time stats could drive engagement. It wasn’t just for gambling. It was for fans everywhere -- especially younger fans who shouldn't be encouarged to gamble.

I knew that images had more engagement than text on social media. So, I scaled our content and called our auto-generated images “Stat Shots.”

I had my second shot at making Stattlehip a success.

We tried partnering with leagues and teams. We tested a proof of concept with the NY Jets.

We went through some iterations: style and design mattered so I had to improve my templating engine and image genration to handle custom fots and image background and assets.

They even published some to Instagram and elsewhere.

I took some validation in that teams were posting images for real-time stats like this goal by Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron.

Put these were pre-made stock assets. I was generating them in realtime and allowing fans to engage and adding context. To me it was a mini souvenir of the event.

A few years later, and I bet your could have made these into NFTs and digital crypto collectables.

Stattleship Part II didn't work out. But I'm glad I took the shot.

I learned to scale data pipelines. I processed job queues and transformed data. I honed image-generation techniques.

You can’t win if you don’t score and you can’t score if you don’t take that shot.
