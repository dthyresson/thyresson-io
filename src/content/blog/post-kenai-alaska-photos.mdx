I took these photos in 2002 when I was in Kenai, Alaska on a visit to the Tesoro Petroleum Refinery in Nikiski, Alaska while at Entessa.

At Entessa, we built order to cash and logistics solutions for midstream oil and gas companies like Tesoro, Hess, Hovensa, Valero, Chevron, Sunoco Logitics, and others.

I was part of the cofounding team and we sold the company in 2010.

Both of these photos are of Mount Redoubt looking across the Cook Inlet. It erupted seven years later in 2009.

I used this as my desktop wallpaper for a few years.

These photos were taken in 2002 with a small Canon digital camera - yes there were no iPhones yet!

I had to take many shots to get the timing of the sun to align with the peak.
