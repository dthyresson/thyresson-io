Here’s the updated version with a strong TED-style opening sentence at the very top, tied to the theme of on-demand vs. real experience:

# The One Thing I’d Tell My Niece and Nephew: Go See Live Music

**In a world where everything is on-demand, live music is the one thing that still demands you to show up.**

If there’s one piece of advice I could give to my younger self—or to my niece and nephew—it’s this: **go to as many concerts as you can**. Don’t let the ease of streaming fool you into thinking you’ve experienced music just because you’ve played it on Spotify, YouTube, or wherever.

Streaming is incredible, but live music is something else entirely. It’s energy. It’s community. It’s imperfect and raw and _alive_.

And here’s the thing: I can’t say I saw _enough_ shows—but the ones I did? They were **epic**. The kind of nights that stick with you for decades. The lights. The sound that rattles your bones. That moment when everyone in the crowd knows the lyric, and you’re singing with strangers. That doesn’t happen on your phone.

When I look back, some of my most vivid memories aren’t about stuff I owned or things I scrolled past—they’re about being in those rooms, those fields, those nights. Here are some of the shows I’ve been lucky enough to experience, in the order they happened. Each one left a mark.

## **Phish — Dec 6, 1991 (Middlebury College, VT)**

A college ballroom show, and the energy was electric. It felt like something special was happening in a small room—and it was.

## **Blues Traveler + Spin Doctors — Apr 23, 1992 (University of Vermont)**

aka Spinning Traveler. This was pure early-’90s college rock magic. Two bands, harmonicas, and the kind of jam vibe that defined an era.

The Godfather of Soul. The energy, the moves, the sheer showmanship—this was a master class in performance.

## **The Chemical Brothers — May 14, 1997 (Métropolis, Montreal)**

Electronic music as a full-body experience. Beats, lights, and the sense that the future had arrived on the dance floor.

## **Sneaker Pimps (with Luke Vibert; Aphex Twin) — Sep 7–8, 1997 (Avalon, Boston)**

This one felt ahead of its time. Trip-hop colliding with experimental electronica, and Aphex Twin bending sound into shapes no one else dared.

Metric system

Techno pushes the speed limit

by Matt Ashare

The Aphex Twin The tone for this year's CMJ Musicfest -- and, in a sense, for the big trend of late '97 -- was set by the opening-night party last week at Roseland in New York City, where a handful of techno dudes (Crystal Method, Daft Punk, Fluke, Death in Vegas, and the Aphex Twin) were joined by the higher-profile, femme-fatale-fronted British outfit the Sneaker Pimps. It was a stiff shot of the new electronica served with a fizzy rock chaser from a band who shrewdly filter their fluid techno-pop through layered sheets of overdriven guitar. Or, as I began to think, it was electronica's sleek new metric system of finely calibrated BPMs inching toward the stubborn American mainstream (if such a thing still exists) in steps still measured by the, um, familiar yardstick of modern rock.
A pared-down version of the same show, featuring headliners the Sneaker Pimps and the Aphex Twin, with jungle DJ Luke Vibert and the edgy Brit-rock band Linoleum, arrived in Boston, at Avalon, last Sunday. Actually, Linoleum, whose Geffen debut was produced by local Fort Apache dudes Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, arrived too late for the early 5 p.m. show, cutting the bill's rock quotient in half. But there was still plenty of guitar-bass-and-drums from the Sneaker Pimps to balance the drum 'n' bass Vibert spun between sets.

It might have been interesting to see how many people would have shown up just for the Aphex Twin, an eccentric and normally reclusive Cornish-born DJ whose given name, Richard D. James, is also the title of his most recent Elektra CD. (He also records under the names AFX, Polygon Window, Metapharstic, Caustic Window, Dice Man, Joyrex, etc.) James doesn't make songs so much as create intriguing, generally wordless, not necessarily danceable, and often hookless sonic constructions, none of which has been suitable for commercial radio in the US. Yet press coverage coupled with word-of-mouth and an American major-label deal has made him one of the better known sonic auteurs to emerge from Britain's rave culture over the past few years.

As it was, even the Sneaker Pimps, whose trip-hoppy single "6 Underground" (from Becoming X -- released last year in England on Clean Up and this year in the US by Virgin) hit big on radio and MTV, didn't manage to draw a full house for their 6:30 p.m. show, which set dense, computer-enhanced rock against a techno backdrop of ethereal synth tones, ghostly samples, and the screened images of computer data and circuitry diagrams. At their best, the Pimps offer a sleazier, spiritually debased version of Portishead's sensual slow dances, with frontwoman Kelli Dayton's cooing voice seductively grinding against rocky guitars and echoey grooves. The result brings to mind the "dance remixes" of the '80s, whereby technologically savvy rock bands like U2 and Simple Minds would turn their hits over to a producer who would recast the tune as a dance-club number by emphasizing the bass and drum tracks, slapping on a whole lotta reverb, and fading the guitars and vocals in and out of the mix. It also recalls mid-'80s Siouxsie and the Banshees with deeper beats, though I swear the vocal line from "6 Underground" is a permutation of a Tears for Fears hook.

Unfortunately, the Sneaker Pimps weren't even as visually compelling or engaging on stage as the Banshees, who themselves were never known to be a particularly exciting band. And with Dayton's crucial vocal melodies buried in the mix, it was hard to tell the mid-tempo thump of "Becoming X" (the set opener) from the mid-tempo thud of "Walking Zero." Indeed, the Aphex Twin, who hit the stage at 8 p.m., was more entertaining -- and he spent his entire set lying down on a sofa with his head hidden behind an array of mixing consoles.

James began his set by deconstructing a Kraftwerkian synth motif until all that was left was a barrage of rapid-fire beats. He went on to tweak an undulating jungle rhythm until it sounded like a swarm of malfunctioning helicopters, and he layered squiggles on top of blips until they resembled a chorus of Nintendos. Comic relief was provided by a pair of dancing (and humping) stagehands in giant teddy-bear costumes (one pink, one orange), but it was even more amusing to watch a gradually thinning crowd of people watch a guy lie on a sofa for an hour.

At the CMJ Musicfest, the presence of guys like Vibert and James had the effect of making the grungy, Mudhoney-style garage punk of the Murder City Devils (who played a modestly attended Sub Pop showcase) and the country-flavored pop of Amy Rigby (who played on two of the festival's four nights) seem suddenly quaint. But it's not yet clear how or even whether an artist like the Aphex Twin will ever be able to navigate America's sturdy rock infrastructure. The speed limit here is still posted miles per hour, not kilometers and not BPMs.

## **Tortoise (with Oval likely opening) — May 6, 1998 (The Middle East, Cambridge)**

Minimalist, experimental, and hypnotic. Music that made you listen differently—layered, intricate, and deeply alive.

## **The Breeders — Jun 5, 2008 (Paradise Rock Club, Boston)**

A small club, a beloved band, and songs that still sound as vital as the first time you heard them.

### **Why It Matters**

Looking back, I don’t regret a single ticket. Every one of these nights is a story. A place. A feeling that can’t be compressed into a stream.

So here’s what I’d tell you: **make time for live music**. Even if you don’t know every song. Even if you go alone. Even if it means leaving the house when it’s easier not to. Because these are the nights you’ll remember—and they don’t happen on shuffle.

The future will always have playlists. Algorithms will always be ready with “songs you might like.” But what we won’t always have are nights like these—moments when the lights go down, the first note hits, and you’re part of something unrepeatable.

And me? Writing this reminded me of something: it’s been too long since my last show. That needs to change. Because live music isn’t just entertainment—it’s life happening in real time, and I want to be in the room when it does.
