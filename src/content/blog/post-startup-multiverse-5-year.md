# The Startup Multiverse: Why Five Years Reveals the Winning Branch

In the five years I’ve worked with Tom Preston-Werner, I’ve learned many things. One of them is that he loves time-travel stories. The kind with branching timelines, alternate realities, and the tension of choosing which path becomes the “real” future.

It turns out you can see startups the same way. Each idea creates a new branch in the founder’s multiverse. Some timelines fade. Some reinvent themselves. And sometimes—just sometimes—one emerges as the winning branch.

And for Tom, the point where you know which branch survives is five years in:

> Give something five years, if you can. If you have an idea and think, _this is going to change the world_, within five years you’ll know.

## The Startup Multiverse

Startups don’t move forward in straight lines. They branch. Every product iteration, every pivot, every reinvention is a fork in the timeline.

Some branches fall away—features that never caught on, business models that didn’t hold. Others stretch forward—gaining traction, stabilizing, drawing resources and attention.

In this **startup multiverse**, most branches fade. But one—if you’re lucky—emerges as the canonical path, the winning narrative that carries the company forward.

## The Five-Year Filter

Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub, frames five years as the moment of truth: _“You don’t want to spend your whole life doing the one thing that doesn’t work. That’s not a good algorithm for startup success.”_

The first two years are too early—branches are still forming. Years three and four reveal which are strengthening, which are wilting. By year five, the pattern is unmistakable. The multiverse has collapsed into a verdict: either one branch thrives, or none do.

Think of it as a **temporal filter**: a checkpoint in the multiverse. If no branch has stabilized by then, you don’t keep propping up dying timelines. You step into a new future.

## Infinite Branches, Finite Outcomes

You can also think of this as the **Infinite Ideas Theory**:

> There’s no sense in banging your head against the wall for twenty years on an idea that won’t take off. There are infinite ideas, and plenty of them are good enough to actually work.

Even within one startup, infinite micro-futures emerge—pivots, experiments, feature bets. Most are disposable branches. That’s not failure—it’s natural pruning.

The founder’s job is not to keep every branch alive, but to recognize which one deserves the story’s full energy.

## 🌀 Field Note: Famous Winning Branches

Some of the most iconic startups only became what they are today by pruning dead branches and finding the one that stuck:

- **Slack** – Began as an online game studio (Tiny Speck) before pivoting into an internal chat tool. The game faded; the chat branch won.
- **Twitter** – Originally a podcasting platform (Odeo) until Apple entered the space. The team pivoted to a micro-messaging app. That branch became Twitter.
- **Instagram** – Started as Burbn, a cluttered location-based app. The founders noticed people loved just one feature—photo sharing. That branch became the entire story.
- **YouTube** – Launched as a video dating site (“Tune In, Hook Up”). The dating angle fizzled, but general video sharing exploded.
- **Shopify** – Born out of a snowboard e-commerce store. The product wasn’t the boards—it was the underlying store platform. That branch grew into Shopify.

**Lesson:** The startup multiverse of pivots isn’t wasted effort. It’s exploration. Each branch teaches something. But only one becomes the _canonical timeline_.

## Sanity in the Multiverse

In time-travel stories, the danger isn’t branching—it’s refusing to let go of the timelines that are already collapsing. The same goes for founders.

Tom cautions:

> For your own mental sanity, there comes a time to move on. It’s not within the first year, or even the second. But if by the third, fourth, and especially the fifth year things aren’t happening, that’s the signal.

Five years is not about arbitrary patience—it’s about mental clarity. A boundary where you stop propping up dying branches and allow the strongest one to become the canon.

## Closing Loop

The beauty of the startup multiverse is that you don’t need every branch to win. You just need one.

By year five, you’ll know which timeline has become the real plot—the version of the story worth telling. And if no branch has stabilized? Then it’s time to close the book and start another, with a new first chapter waiting in the infinite library of ideas.

Tom reminds me:

> There’s no sense in killing yourself to make an idea work that isn’t timed right, or that you’re not the right person to execute.

Because in his favorite time-travel stories—as in startups—only one timeline becomes canon.
