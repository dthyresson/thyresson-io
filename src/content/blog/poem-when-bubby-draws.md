##### when bubby draws

her mind is a coloring book<br/>
unbound by wax-caked memories,<br/>
pages drawn from the past<br/>
of families<br/>
guarded in camps;<br/>
silent crayons capture<br/>
forgotten faces<br/>
in a book<br/>
struggling<br/>
to remember.
<br/>
<br/>
its pages smell of glue and cigarettes;<br/>
reminders of barbed-wired playgrounds<br/>
where branded corpses,<br/>
whose sapless tears turn<br/>
brackish halos,<br/>
silhouette the earthen<br/>
paper caves.
