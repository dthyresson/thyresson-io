I'm a General Partner at Preston-Werner Ventures where I invest in early stage technology startups with Tom Preston-Werner and David Price.

I’m also part of the 🌲 RedwoodJS Core Team and consulted at ⚡️Supabase a few years ago. Before then I was part of a few 🏟 sports, 🔋 energy-related and 🤔 consulting startups that saw a few exits.
